title: Work-Application Failure TSG
description: Troubleshooting guide for "Applied" condition set to false
weight: 6
---

The `ClusterResourcePlacementApplied` (for ClusterResourcePlacement) or `ResourcePlacementApplied` (for ResourcePlacement) condition is set to `false` when the deployment fails to apply.
> Note: To get more information about why the resources are not applied, you can check the [work applier](https://github.com/kubefleet-dev/kubefleet/blob/main/pkg/controllers/workapplier) logs.

## Common scenarios

Instances where this condition may arise:

- The resource already exists on the cluster and isn't managed by the fleet controller.
- Another placement (ClusterResourcePlacement or ResourcePlacement) is already managing the resource for the selected cluster by using a different apply strategy.
- The placement doesn't apply the manifest because of syntax errors or invalid resource configurations. This might also occur if a resource is propagated through an envelope object.

## Investigation steps

1. **Check `placementStatuses`**: In the placement status section, inspect the `placementStatuses` to identify which clusters have the `ClusterResourcePlacementApplied` (for ClusterResourcePlacement) or `ResourcePlacementApplied` (for ResourcePlacement) condition set to `false` and note down their `clusterName`.
2. **Locate the `Work` Object in Hub Cluster**: Use the identified `clusterName` to locate the `Work` object associated with the member cluster.
   - For ClusterResourcePlacement, refer to [this section](ClusterResourcePlacement#how-can-i-find-the-correct-work-resource-thats-associated-with-clusterresourceplacement)
   - For ResourcePlacement, refer to [this section](ResourcePlacement#how-can-i-find-the-correct-work-resource-thats-associated-with-resourceplacement)
3. **Check `Work` object status**: Inspect the status of the `Work` object to understand the specific issues preventing successful resource application.

## Case Study: ClusterResourcePlacement

In the following example, a `ClusterResourcePlacement` is trying to propagate a namespace that contains a deployment to two member clusters. However, the namespace already exists on one member cluster, specifically `kind-cluster-1`.

### ClusterResourcePlacement spec

```
  policy:
    clusterNames:
    - kind-cluster-1
    - kind-cluster-2
    placementType: PickFixed

  - group: ""
    kind: Namespace
    name: test-ns
    version: v1
  revisionHistoryLimit: 10
  strategy:

```

    version: v1
```

In the ClusterResourcePlacement status, within the `failedPlacements` section for `kind-cluster-1`, we get a clear message
as to why the resource failed to apply on the member cluster. In the preceding `conditions` section,
the `ClusterResourcePlacementApplied` condition for `kind-cluster-1` is flagged as false and shows the `NotAllWorkHaveBeenApplied` reason.
This indicates that the Work object intended for the member cluster `kind-cluster-1` has not been applied.

To inspect the Work object for more details, follow the steps in the [Investigation steps](#investigation-steps) section above.

      version: v1
```

From looking at the `Work` status, specifically the `manifestConditions` section, you can see that the namespace could not be applied but the deployment within the namespace got propagated from the hub to the member cluster.

### Resolution

In this situation, a potential solution is to set the `AllowCoOwnership` to `true` in the ApplyStrategy policy. However, it's important to notice that this decision should be made by the user because the resources might not be shared.

## General Troubleshooting Notes

The troubleshooting process and Work object inspection are identical for both ClusterResourcePlacement and ResourcePlacement:

- Both use the same underlying Work API to apply resources to member clusters
- The Work object status and manifestConditions have the same structure regardless of whether they were created by a ClusterResourcePlacement or ResourcePlacement
- The main difference is the scope: ClusterResourcePlacement is cluster-scoped and can select both cluster-scoped and namespace-scoped resources, while ResourcePlacement is namespace-scoped and can only select namespace-scoped resources within its own namespace

For ResourcePlacement-specific considerations:

- Ensure the target namespace exists on member clusters before the ResourcePlacement tries to apply resources to it
- ResourcePlacement can only select resources within the same namespace where the ResourcePlacement object itself resides
